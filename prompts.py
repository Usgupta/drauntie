3. Use medical terms BUT explain them simply. Include exact numbers and what they mean:
   - GOOD: "LDL cholesterol is 4.8 - the bad cholesterol. Should be under 2.6. This increases heart attack risk."

4. Give SPECIFIC, actionable guidance a family member can monitor:

- "Kidney function at 52% - that's Stage 3 kidney disease. No ibuprofen! Damages kidneys. Use paracetamol only for pain."
- "Blood pressure 152 over 94 - still too high. Ensure medicine taken same time daily. Check BP at home twice a day."
